 * <p>The registry given to entities so that they can look up the services hosted on the platform.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Note that the Service instances returned by this interface are not cached or interned, in any way (unless the
 *  underlying ServiceProvider decides to add that functionality).  This means that multiple requests for the same service,
 *  through the same registry, could return different instances.</p>
 * 
 * <p>ServiceProvider implementations see each call through a ServiceRegistry as originating from a specific consumerID,
 *  which is per-entity.  Using this mechanism is how a service knows which entity is contacting it, no matter how many
 *  instances of its underlying service were returned through repeated getService calls.  More information regarding
 *  consumerIDs can be found in {@link ServiceProvider}.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Note about using services together:  Services are not explicitly granted access to each other as there would be no
 *  consumerID to identify them to each other.  However, it is possible to use services together, so long as the entity and
 *  calling service know that they aren't going to collide in their usage of the underlying service they wish to access.
 *  This is because any service instance fetched through a given ServiceRegistry will have the same consumerID.  Therefore,
 *  it is possible to pass something fetched from one service, or even the entire ServiceRegistry, into another via its
 *  configuration or its public interface.  This is safe so long as the entity and calling service know that they are
 *  sharing access to the same underlying resource.</p>
