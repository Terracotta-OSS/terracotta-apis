 * A SyncMessageCodec is for converting high level Passive Sync Messages (currently we are using EntityMessage)
 * into byte[] and vice-versa
 *
 * Note that the implementation cannot assume when it will be called, relative to any other calls related to the entity, or
 * even that the calls will be made sequentially.  Multiple messages should be concurrently serialized or deserialized.
 * Also, encode/decode may not be called on the same object and invocations could be across jvms (for example, client and
 * server jvms on different machines). This means that an implementation is expected to be state-less and each returned
 * {@link EntityMessage} or byte[] must not be cached or reused.
